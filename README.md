# CoffeeCraze
The name of our game is Coffee Craze!
## Narrative Structure
The goal of our game is to have our hero protect the town from the monsters by giving them what they really want: Coffee! Can you keep the thirsty monsters from ransacking your town?
## Mechanics
Using the W A S D keys to move around, you need to throw coffee at the monsters using the mouse! They will pay you for your services, and you can use your coins in the shop to upgrade your coffee!
## Aesthetics
We went for a pixelated medieval setting because we found a lot of cool assets that fit that theme.
## Joys and Struggles
We really enjoyed watching the game come together. We did not like all the merge conflicts we ran into because we did not plan ahead.
