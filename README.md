## Narrative Structure
The goal of our game is to have our hero.
## Mechanics
Using the W A S D keys to move around, you need to bring coffee to the thirsty monsters to prevent them from ransacking your town! They will pay you for your services, and you can use your coins in the shop to upgrade your coffee!
## Aesthetics
We went for a pixelated medieval setting because we found a lot of cool assets that fit that theme.
